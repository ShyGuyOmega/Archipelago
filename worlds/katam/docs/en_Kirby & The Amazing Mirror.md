# Kirby & The Amazing Mirror

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and
export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle, the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

Mirrors can be randomized, which has two modes: Normal, and Total Random. In Normal, mirrors are randomized with mirrors of a similar type, i.e. two-way mirrors (mirrors that have a big star above them) and one-way mirrors (mirrors that have a smaller star above them). Enabling Total Random turns this off, and shuffles everything together.

Items and chests can also be randomized, including all overworld pickups such as 1UPs, health, batteries, and candies. All big chests become small chests in this mode, which is simply a cosmetic change. In addition, minibosses, ability stands, spray palettes, and music can all be randomized.

## What is the goal of Kirby & The Amazing Mirror when randomized?

Restore the Dimension Mirror in Central Circle, enter it, and defeat Dark Meta Knight & Dark Mind. This requires the player to find or receive all 8 Mirror Shards.

## What items and locations can get shuffled?

Every chest, item, and Mirror Shard (from the 8 bosses) can be randomized throughout the multiworld.

## What does another world's item look like in Kirby & The Amazing Mirror?

Items will appear as an Archipelago logo when picked up out of a chest, or seen on the ground within any rooms.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Items will be placed directly into the player's inventory after a few seconds.
